Dear Marker, The rar file contains the following:
1) The A014418E CNN juPyter notebook includes testing done on the CNN
2) The A014418E MLP juPyter notebook includes testing done on the MLP
3) The report in Pdf and Word versions
4) /json_history folder contains history files generated from MLP notebook only.
5) /json_history(from lab) contains history files generated when I was running 
models in a separate computer lab. These models are presented in the two noteboooks
This is because my laptop is unable to run these models (due to GPU's poor performance)

6) The /json_history(from lab) contains the following:
6.1) The history files
6.2) Plot.py is the script to generate different graphs from these history files
6.3) /img folder contains these graphs. (for your reference)

Thank you and sorry for any inconvenience caused.
